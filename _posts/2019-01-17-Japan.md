## **Travel Logistics**
- Jan 17 AirCanada Denver (DEN) > Vancouver (YVR) > Tokyo (NRT)
- Jan 19 JetStar Narita (NRT) > Chitose (CTS)
- Jan 25 JetStar Chitose (CTS) > Narita (NRT)
- Jan 26 AirCanada Narita (NRT) > Vancouver (YVR) > Denver (DEN)

- **First Night in Tokyo**
Took trains from NRT to ANA Intercontinental Hotel.  This required two trains one express (Skyride) to Ueno station and then subway to a stop near the hotel.  Not reccomended with skis the subway was packed since it was around rush hour when we arrived and we got some odd looks. The hotel was very nice.

- **Travel Day to Hokkaido**
Went back out to NRT the next morning, after slamming an amazing breakfast buffet, via bus from hotel (pricey but worth it) to get a flight up to Chitose (CTS). Once in Chitose we needed to take a train to a stop near the van rental location.  Again traveling with skis was somewhat painful.  The train was packed and being out of sorts from the time change we had some questions as to what train to get on but we figured it out.

   When we arrived at the train station we went to find a cab to get us to the van rental shop.  At first we attempted to fit our 200cm long ski bag and luggage into a tiny corrola but failed.  Shortly after a larger cab rolled up. The cabbies were very friendly and easy to communicate with, without words.

   We booked a camper van for three nights from https://japanrv-rental.com/.  Not sure if this was the cheapest route but the van was in great shape and had all the amenities to sleep and cook in, in freezing temps.  I would do it again.  Still if I do make this trip again I may consider a rental car and staying at lodging connected to some of the onsens.  The van rental guys were very nice and a little old lady brought us coffee while we filled out paperwork.
  

## **Ski Days** 

- **Mt. Yotei 1/20**
Our first day skiing was spent on Mt. Yotei. After a hardy breakfast of egg and cemembert sandwiches from the local Lawson's we drove up to what looked like a church in our camper van. The trail head was covered in snow but pretty straight forwad.  We gratefully poached a well set skin track that lead us East a bit then meandered up the mountain.  

  Yotei is a popular spot especially where we were accessing it, still there was no one in the parking lot when we arrived and maybe three other groups when we got going.  The track up was easy to follow and we went as high as the visibility permitted. It is possible on a clear day to summit Yotei but our objective was to simply find a safe zone to lap.  We found exactly that.  The snow blew our minds away lap after lap which got us pretty excited for the rest of the trip.

- **Mt. Shiribetsu 1/21**
Second day we headed for Mt. Shiribetsu just to the south east of Yotei.  After having skied such great snow on Yotei the day before we were hesitant to change venues but stoked for something new.   After pulling into what smelled like a dump and being scared off by crows we found a parking spot on the NW corner of Shiribetsu.  This may not have been the ideal spot but we did see a pair of skiers entering here as well.  Being unfamiliar with the mountain we decided to follow suit.  The skin track led us across a flat farm field to the mountain.  This day was really cold and the wind up on the ridge was even colder. The skiing was great although we did come across some wind blown sections and sun affected snow. We stayed warm doing laps and called it a day at dusk.

- **Mt. Iwaonapuri 1/22**
The snow never stopped our third day at Mt. Iwanoapuri. It was blower powder, we got pitted.  Setting our own skin track like big kids time and found another great area to lap over and over. I didn't want to stop.  This was the closest proximity to the Niseko ski area and in turn, the most people.  There is a great onsen at the base which probably increases its draw as well.  It was phenomenal, hard to top skiing hard then soaking in natural spring water.

- **Mt. Furano 1/24**
To our regret we were supposed to fly out of Chitose back to Toyko on 1/23 but were delighted the flight was cancelled due to snow. Yay rest day!  We could have rebooked for the next morning but having just skied Iwaonupuri the day before we decided to have another go at finding more powder.  We decided to head North East to Furano.  It was a little difficult to find a rental car but we eventually locked down a 4 wheel drive Corolla hatch back that crushed.  Don't forget to pay $20 USD for an International Drivers License! The roads were snow packed and it took 3+ hours to get to Furano but we made it.  

  The skiing turned out to be challenging due to the sheer amount of snow.  Breaking trail and finding a steep enough shot to ski proved difficult.  Visibility was zero up high.  Finally Dana was able to set a track up to a nice steep line in the trees later in the day and it provided some really deep mind bender blower pow.
